# Step 1 : Cleaning
This room was originally used for storage, Filled to the walls with anything and everything. We wanted to turn this space into a livable space. We started by cleaning it out, throwing things away, donating, and putting stuff into storage. Then we removed the old pink carpet and all of the trim.

# Step 2: Paint
Then we moved on to paint. We painted all of the walls gray with the intention of adding white trim and an accent wall. The accent wall was important to bring color into the room, but we wanted to do it in a way that would make the room feel as adalt as possible. We ended up going with a really cool geometric design.

# Step 3: Subfloor and Flooring
Then floors. The floors were an important step in the process because they were very squeaky. One of the things we made sure to do was to add new OSB and use screws to attach it to the floor joists. This house was built before 1990, meaning that when they built the floor originally, they attached the subfloor via nails. Over time, those nails get loose and rub on the wood when you walk on that part of the flooring. Thus, you get squeaky floors. Once we removed the old subfloor and added new OSB via screws, the squeak was gone.  
Now that that is taken care of, we were able to put down a new vinyl plank that fits the space perfectly.

# Final Resalt
Along the way, I replaced fixtures, the toilet, closet hardware, trim, outlets, painted doors and cabinets, painted an accent wall, and more. This was a very fun and rewarding project that anyone could do. All of the information for this project was gathered from YouTube, which is a great resource when starting your own DIY project.
