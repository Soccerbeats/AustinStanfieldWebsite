THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.

The mudroom was one of the first projects of the new house. The previous owners used the room to smoke in and the smell was awful. We sanded all of the wood walls, I sprayed a coat of odor-blocking primer and 2 coats of white primer, then we rolled and touched up after that. We painted the ceiling a nice gray color.

To come on this project:
* Tim
* Doors
* The window will be removed dividing the kitchen and the mudroom
* Decorations
