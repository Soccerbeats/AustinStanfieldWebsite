This was an awesome project. very easy and super fun. I Build the frame out of 2Ã—4â€™s and used the old wood boards from the mudroom that I removed. Reclaimed Wood!! ðŸ™‚ Itâ€™s 3.5â€² by 7â€² with an added cubby for wood and material to rest. It turned out great and was a great first woodworking project at the new house.
